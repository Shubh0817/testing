00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.750
So organizational structure definitely
plays a role in terms of how

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.500
successful DevOps transformation can be.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.760
And I think this is where it's important
to understand that as a DevOps

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.890
practitioner you are taking a set
of software development and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.480
operational practices as a base.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.170
But maybe what you are really doing
is you're doing some community

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.610
organization.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.680
And so, I think it's important
to understand that your role is

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.870
one of someone who is promoting change,
and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.370
this is different from
being a change agent.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.410
So often people think of themselves as,
I'm the change agent and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.850
so, sorry change agents.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.030
But [LAUGH] the way that that
role then gets played is you run

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.060
around inside the organization
seeking permission for change.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.818
And so
in a very hierarchical organization,

00:00:54.818 --> 00:01:00.379
the pattern that that's going to take
is your in an organizational silo.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.330
You see that maybe you can reach
out to the silo right next to you.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.180
But you're only path for
communication is straight up,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.290
maybe up to the point at which there's
two people playing golf, right.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.990
And then all the way
back down to the bottom.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.280
And that takes time, it's frustrating,
and often you go unheard.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
I think the real limitation there
is the limitation of language.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.020
So I think, it's maybe more important
inside of an organization that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.570
is heavily siloed or sort of heavily
structured in that way to take actions

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.240
that support your goals in ways
that are that are safe but

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.340
that can also communicate value.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.970
For instance,
even in the strongest silo, when you can

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.130
identify real organizational pinpoints
and take a step toward alleviating them.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.982
And in today's world these can be
done using open source projects.

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:03.360
There are many ways in which they can
be, these problems can be approached

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.199
with a light weight experiment
that's sort of low cost.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:12.130
I think that's when you are having
now a conversation that isn't one

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.490
about organizational structure on
its face but it's one about value.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.730
I think that what you're
doing is you're changing your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.680
relationship to
the organization from one

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.990
of permission-seeking to
one of value-seeking.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.590
And I think when you make that
fundamental change internally and you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.630
use that language and you take actions
to support it, people will join you.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.920
I have seen a lot of very siloed
structured organizations, but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.360
I have never found the person inside
them that said I do not want to get

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.780
to the big bag of money at the end
of my sort of company journey.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.240
Everyone wants to be successful,
everyone wants to be happy.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.050
And often what we're trying to do is
we're trying to figure out the right way

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.050
to match the solution that we see
to the desire that they're seeking.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.608
And I think when you can do that it's
both magical, and it's hugely valuable.

00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:09.467
And at that point, the organizational
components really disappear because

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.568
now we're talking about value.

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:14.670
I don't want to pretend that
organizational structure doesn't exist.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.520
And I don't want to pretend that
there aren't organizations in which

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.110
certain kinds of permission
are going to be required.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.240
You have to be very careful about where
you choose in your organization to test

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.830
these waters.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.670
People security concerns are valid.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.790
What goes into a build,
how a build gets out in the world,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.550
how software gets created,
people care deeply about these things.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.710
And often the structure that exists
around them is there for a reason.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.180
So, choose carefully and choose wisely.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.180
The goal is not to get
you tilting at windmills.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.260
The goal is to take clear responsible
steps toward relieving the problems

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.230
that you see using the tooling that
you're going to learn in this class.
