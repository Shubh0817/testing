00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.388
[MUSIC]

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:08.652
Conway's law was the idea that
what we create is a reflection of

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:10.260
our communication patterns.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.350
Specifically, he was
talking about software,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.780
but we can take a broader approach for
a second.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.100
Silos are often simply
communication models.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.970
It's the way in which
decision-making and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.020
sort of ownership around a particular
set of problems gets discussed.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.560
And so, one way that you can
start to break down the silo,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.490
which is the first step,
like if it's animosity that's developed,

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.400
the first step is bringing those
people into your people, right?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.560
What you want,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.560
is you want to stop having the
perspective that the silo is the thing.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.810
I often tell organizations to
stop shipping their org chart.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.740
The very first thing that happens,
typically,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.790
as we see that we're good at something,
is we want to double down on that value.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.489
And so we do that by declaring,
this team does X..

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.740
And so, we start to align and
concentrate on a functional silo.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.880
We put all the like things together.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.100
Well, let me try to address
the history for a second, right?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.021
I often ask development teams and
people doing a DEVap's transformation,

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.750
I ask them this simple question,
does a DBA need a database?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.960
And then, people look at me
like I have nine heads, right?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.490
But of course,
a DBA doesn't need a database.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.060
DBAs were created, in some way,
by software engineers

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
who didn't want to deal with
the underlying complexity.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.120
They needed a place to store their data,
but they didn't want to have to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.080
deal with the runtime consequences
of bringing that database in.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.350
And so, right off the bat in that model,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.700
a silo gets created through
a particular kind of conversation.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.710
As a software developer,
my value is solving problems with code.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.180
Surely, there must be some other place,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.630
some other functional group,
that can be accountable for

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.650
the build aspects of my software,
that can be responsible for

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.660
the infrastructure required to run it,
who can manage it in production.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470
So, we can talk about all
of these ways in which

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.560
I can maximize my personal
value as a software developer

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.710
by not being distracted by
the consequences of the choices I make.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.810
And I think that DevOps takes
a totally different approach.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.930
It says, sure,
there are a number of skills that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.180
need to be applied in order to
ensure that the software and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.810
technology that we build
is stable in production.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.350
But it does not, the approach
that it takes is one in which,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.320
is an inclusive one, that says we
are all sort of co-responsible.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.370
So yeah, bring it, right,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.120
if you're a database expert,
bring that expertise into the team.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.860
But what I'm not going to do is I'm
not going to force you into a box in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.440
which that's the only way that you can
express your creative intelligence,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.966
with relation to this product that
we're putting out in the world.

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:14.380
As a matter of fact, I don't want that,
because you have had a broad history and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.830
career, [LAUGH] you probably have,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.120
there's probably a lot of awesome that
you can bring, in terms of understanding

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.680
that product, in terms of understanding
how it works in the world.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.740
So, the approach that I would
take toward the animosity

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.150
would be first to heal it, right?

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.650
Like, the first thing you want to do is
you want to meet the people in the silo.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.110
Hey [LAUGH], I'm right over here.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.200
A lot of people have
that open spaces now.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.910
My desk is right over there.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.790
I would introduce yourself.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.720
I would get to understand how and
why you were separated,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.050
by understanding what value these people
bring, how they express that value.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.110
And then I would look for

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.950
places where you can combine to improve
something in the infrastructure.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.800
I bring that idea of sort of kaizen,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.700
that's sort of gradual change over time,
or team improvement over time.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.220
I would bring that idea
to your interactions.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.019
So it's nice to get to know people,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.140
it's great to make friends at work,
and I think that that's the basis.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.130
Hi [LAUGH], who are you?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.130
This is who I am.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.940
What do you do?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.780
This is what I do.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.750
I think the very next step is, how

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.470
can we work together to make something
that's better than what we have today?
