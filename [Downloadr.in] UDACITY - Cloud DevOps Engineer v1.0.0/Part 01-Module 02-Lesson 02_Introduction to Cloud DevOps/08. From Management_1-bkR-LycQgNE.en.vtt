00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:13.297
Well let's take the case where you're
a manager and you don't feel like

00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:18.000
you have the capacity or maybe you
don't have the shared language.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.386
It sometimes happens that people
there's a fork in your career and

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:24.800
over time you become less
technical as a manager.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.605
That doesn't block your empathy,
so you can see and

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:29.790
hear what your team is struggling with.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.271
So I think often it's enough to create a
space in which experimentation is okay,

00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:36.168
it's safe.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:40.873
I don't want to dig too deeply
into the psychology of managing in

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.643
the text space, but I will say this.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:48.375
Both the goal and the role of
a management position inside of in

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:53.430
tech today is one of supporting
teams and team learning.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.186
So you can just take the approach of
my role here is to create a space

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:02.855
in which this team can learn its way
out of the pain that it sees and

00:01:02.855 --> 00:01:04.515
that is often enough.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:05.340
Could you add money?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.338
Could you add resources?

00:01:06.338 --> 00:01:10.865
Sure and
you should at every responsible moment.

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:16.091
But prior to that, you just need to
encourage a strong culture of learning.

00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:19.807
As a manager I think your
primary role especially early

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:24.488
is to create a culture of learning to
to make it sort of safe and open for

00:01:24.488 --> 00:01:26.780
people to experiment and learn.
