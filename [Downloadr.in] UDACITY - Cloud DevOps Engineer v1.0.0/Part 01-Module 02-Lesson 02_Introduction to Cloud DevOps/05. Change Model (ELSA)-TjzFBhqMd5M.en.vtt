00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.429
[MUSIC]

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.943
So also is a change model that I share
with organizations that are going

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:12.240
through devops transformation.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360
In that change model we
begin with an event,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.890
we do something in the organization
that is new or different.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.830
This could be the automation
of infrastructure,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.210
it could be automated test coverage,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.690
it could be any number of things that
we do to improve our release practice.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.180
On the basis of that event,
we have new language now.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.210
So often what you get from the
organization is that we can't do X or

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.160
Y, that's not possible.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.880
And so as the change agent,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.010
as the devops engineer inside of your
organization, you then go and do this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.540
thing that was that had previously
been believed to be impossible.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.200
And now we have new language
in the organization.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.240
Even if the language had been no prior,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.950
now the language is [LAUGH] Okay I
guess that is a thing we could do.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.889
&gt;From that perspective now,

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:04.694
structure inside the organization
begins to give way.

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:08.381
And as that does, you have more agency,
more flexibility,

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.493
more freedom to act in that space.

00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:16.882
And so you have Event,
Language, Structure, Agency.
