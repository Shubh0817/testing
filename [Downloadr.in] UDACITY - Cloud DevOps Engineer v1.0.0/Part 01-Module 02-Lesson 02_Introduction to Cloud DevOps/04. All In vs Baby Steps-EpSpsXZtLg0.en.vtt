00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.384
When it comes to the question of
whether you dive in head first or

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:16.030
whether you take baby steps, I think
the answer is probably that you do both.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.360
Meaning you find a place where you
know you can make a difference.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.380
So, maybe that's going to be through
the automation of infrastructure, or

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.500
maybe that's going to be
improving test coverage.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.380
Maybe it's going to be implementing
some continuous integration, or

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.360
even a step toward continuous delivery.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.230
And you should really dive in with the
full intention to realize that value.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.480
At the same time though you want Sir
Vigrid principles to be able to work for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.860
you in this context.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
So, I don't know how a mountain
goat approaches the mountain right.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.700
But I think it's with the intention
of getting where it wants to go but

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.390
how does it do?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.130
It it takes a tentative step and
each time it tests a little bit, right.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.880
How did that work for

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.370
me and then moves forward and I think
that's the way that you should do it, so

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.030
you should bring your whole self
your whole intention to the effort.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.510
I mean just give an example of what
going all the end could mean in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.480
a negative way or in a different
context and you are then you by all

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.240
the things [LAUGH] you write, you buy
all the software, you hire a giant team.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.080
I don't think you have
to start in that way.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.490
I think what you have to be clear
about is where you want to get to and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.895
what thing you're going to
do first to make an impact.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.978
And I think that's
the thing you go all in on.

00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:35.293

00:01:35.293 --> 00:01:38.809
Often, the places where a DevOps
Engineer is going to be asked to start

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:42.564
working are in the places where the
organization is feeling the most pain or

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:44.290
is suffering the most.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.920
So, I guess there's nobility there
in the same way that there is for

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.790
an early responder.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.990
I don't want to make
this overly dramatic.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.310
There's a book that I really love,
it's called Your Code Is A Crime Scene.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.660
And if that's real and there's some
evidence to support that idea,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.320
the DevOps Engineer shows
up in that space and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.460
is going to work to make things better.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.830
So all in, on an area in
which you can make an effort,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.918
that's really going to pay off.

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:13.440
All in on some global sense,
like I have to decide early on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.250
what tooling I pay for, I have to decide
early on what methodologies I use.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.626
I think that might be a mistake.

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.320
As a matter of fact,
you'd be creating structure

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.530
ahead of any kind of learning and
that might be damaging.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.580
So, I like the mountain goat metaphor.
