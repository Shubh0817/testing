[MUSIC]

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:11.366
I think you can gain a measure of
success coming from either the bottom up

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.580
or the top down, but
I think there's a limitation.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.310
So, I think it really it
takes the whole village.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.140
We can start from the bottom, and
we can get a measure of success.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.260
You can automate infrastructure.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.604
You can start to spread some
knowledge about those practices.

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:28.000
You can start from the top.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.820
You can mandate.
Or you can

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.724
try to create
an environment in which you

00:00:30.724 --> 00:00:33.862
are looking to avoid snowflakes
in your production environment.

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:37.440
And that kind of messaging
will go some way.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.244
But at some point,
you need a common or shared goal.

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:44.768
I think this is where the XP principle
of a shared metaphor is really important

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.730
organizationally.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.760
You want everyone to understand the
context around what better looks like.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.540
And I think that that can't come
just from the line of execution.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.000
In the same way that it
cannot come from the top.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.364
I think in lean there's this idea of
going to the place where the work

00:01:03.364 --> 00:01:04.063
happens.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.433
It's going to the gamba.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.856
And I think that's a great metaphor for

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:11.971
how the leadership in an organization
and the line of execution can

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.030
come together to make a DevOps
transformation super effective.
